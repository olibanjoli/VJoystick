# Intro

The VJoystick application enables wireless control of a generic Windows game controller using a VBarControl Touch, allowing it to be used with a wide range of flight simulators and games. While some simulators natively support the protocol developed by Mikado, they remain in the minority. VJoystick fills this gap by providing a versatile solution that can be used with any simulator or game that supports Windows joysticks.

### Limitations

It's important to note that Direct Input, the input API used by this application, has a maximum support for only 8 axes. As a result, not all the axes on the VBarControl Touch are available for use with the software. The following axes are currently available:

- Pitch
- Tail
- Ailerons
- Elevator
- Pot1
- Pot2
- Trim1
- Trim2 (currently not working)

Technically, it is possible to use two game controllers controlled by one VBarControl Touch to access all the axes. However, for most simulator applications, 8 axes should be sufficient to provide a satisfying flying/training experience. Only Trim3/Trim4 are not usable. For buttons there are no limitations, all buttons of the VBCt are mapped.
